HI, this is a project to automate the process of online classes 
in this we are gonna fetch the link from the whatsapp(note;= curently this is not possible but will be in future updates, for now we manually have to paste the link) and then close the whatsapp tab and then we open the meet link in a new tab and we mute camera and mic and with the help of a extention we auto join the meet 
and after that python is gonna auto close the tab after desired time in case of mine i have setted 3300 sec 
and you have to configure this according to your desired way
